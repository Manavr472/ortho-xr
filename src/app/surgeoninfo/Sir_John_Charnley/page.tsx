                <p className="mt-4">
                    John Charnley was born in Bury on August 29,
                    1911. He was educated at Bury Grammar School
                    and Manchester University, where he was
                    awarded several prizes and scholarships. He made
                    his ambition for a surgical career plain by passing
                    the primary examination of the Royal College of
                    Surgeons while he was an undergraduate—a feat
                    that was possible for the gifted students of those
                    days—and he became a Fellow of the college in
                    1936, 1 year after graduating in medicine.
                    Before the outbreak of the Second World War
                    he held surgical appointments at Manchester
                    Royal Infirmary and Salford Royal Hospital. It
                    was evident then to his mentors and contemporaries that he was destined for a brilliant career.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4">
                    During his period of army service, spent in the
                    Middle East, he used every opportunity to work
                    in the REME workshops where he produced an
                    adjustable Thomas&apos; splint, which was widely used
                    in the treatment of casualties from the North
                    African campaigns. This engineering experience
                    was later put to good use in his biomechanical
                    laboratory.
                    After the war, Charnley returned to Manchester; he was appointed lecturer in orthopedic
                    surgery and started a long and fruitful association
                    with Sir Harry Platt. They had much in common,
                    a directness of vision and purpose and a dislike
                    of humbug. Sir Harry was one of John&apos;s
                    staunchest supporters and was instrumental in
                    persuading the Regional Hospital Board to back
                    his revolutionary concept of a Centre for Hip
                    Surgery. John maintained that significant
                    advances in surgery could only be achieved by
                    concentrating effort and research on a specific
                    problem, a philosophy amply vindicated when the
                    center at Wrightington became the Mecca for
                    orthopedic surgeons from all over the world.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4">
                    In 1947 he was appointed Consultant Orthopedic Surgeon to Manchester Royal Infirmary and
                    in 1950 his book on the Closed Treatment of
                    Common Fractures was published. It was an original and stimulating approach to the manipulative
                    treatment of fractures “which far from being a
                    crude and uncertain art can be resolved into something of a science.” It was an instant success and
                    persuaded many orthopedic surgeons to revise
                    some of their cherished suppositions.
                    In the late 1940s arthrodesis was regarded as
                    an acceptable treatment for a stiff and painful
                    joint, but no entirely reliable procedures were
                    available. His technique of compression arthrodesis of the knee, published in 1948, was simple and
                    highly effective. The principle of this operation
                    was extended to the hip and other joints. Compression arthrodesis of the hip was an ingenious
                    procedure but it required considerable technical
                    expertise and even in Charnley&apos;s hands it was not
                    always successful. He realized that fusion of the
                    hip could only have a limited application and he
                    turned his fertile mind to solving the problems
                    of replacing the joint. Cup arthroplasty was an
                    anathema to him; it offended his engineering principles and required a prolonged period of rehabilitation. Total joint replacement was the only
                    solution.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4">
                    Charnley was appointed Professor of Orthopedic Surgery at Manchester Royal Infirmary in
                    1972. He was appointed as a Doctor of Science
                    of Manchester University in 1964 for his work on
                    bone union and lubrication of joints. His remarkable achievements in the development of total
                    joint replacement had received worldwide
                    acclaim and the award of many honors and decorations. He was made a Commander of the
                    British Empire in 1970 and Knight Bachelor in
                    1977. In 1975 he was elected a Fellow of the
                    Royal Society, an honor unique in the history of
                    British orthopedics. The citation for the Lister
                    Medal awarded the same year was an admirable
                    summary of his achievements. “In a period of
                    some 15 years totally concentrated on this difficult problem by a combination of engineering,
                    biological science, and superb surgical technique
                    he has resolved these problems to the immense
                    benefit of tens of thousands of patients. His investigation of the mechanical, material, and surgical
                    problems of total replacement of the hip have
                    helped to advance joint replacement in the knee,
                    elbow and elsewhere.” He received honorary doctorates of the Universities of Liverpool, Leeds,
                    Belfast and Uppsala and was an honorary member
                    of numerous orthopedic associations in Europe
                    and North and South America. In 1978 he was
                    awarded the Gold Medal of the British Medical
                    Association and later he became an Honorary
                    Fellow of the British Orthopedic Association.
                    One of the honors that gave him special pleasure
                    was conferred on him by the citizens of Bury in
                    1974, who made him a freeman of the borough.
                    Charnley&apos;s approach to surgery was always that
                    of a perfectionist. This is reflected in his report,
                    Low Friction Arthroplasty of the Hip: Theory
                    and Practice, published in 1979, in which he
                    described the operation in minute detail. For some
                    years he insisted that surgeons who wished to
                    perform the operation must first master the technique by working with him at Wrightington.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4">
                    There were those who thought that this was an
                    attempt to maintain the unique position of the
                    Centre for Hip Surgery, but this was not so, he
                    was determined that surgeons should not undertake the operation with only general knowledge
                    of the principle in the hope that they could
                    improvize the details. A constant stream of surgeons came to Wrightington from all over the
                    world, where they were treated to a surgical tour
                    de force and at the same time warned of the
                    mishaps that could and did occur from shoddy
                    surgery.
                    He had no time for medical politics or committees and it was the “establishment” more than
                    anything else that provoked his occasional explosions of anger. He worked with unabated energy
                    after his retirement from the Health Service in
                    1976 and lost none of his interest and enthusiasm
                    for research.
                    John had a lighter side, he loved a party and
                    had a great sense of fun. He enjoyed messing
                    61
                    Who&apos;s Who in Orthopedics
                    about in boats and in his younger days he was a
                    keen skier. It was on one these holidays in 1957
                    that he met his wife Jill; they were married 3
                    months later and had two children, Tristram and
                    Henrietta. Jill was a gifted and charming hostess;
                    she created a beautiful home and a delightful
                    garden at Mere in Cheshire, where she and John
                    entertained their many friends and visitors from
                    home and abroad with great generosity.
                    John Charnley, one of the most remarkable
                    surgical innovators of this generation, died on
                    August 5, 1982. He will be remembered by posterity for his low-friction arthroplasty of the
                    hip, the inspiration of a surgical revolution that
                    brought relief to countless patients crippled by
                    arthritis.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4">
                    Charnley is assured of a permanent niche in the
                    annals of British orthopedic surgery. He will be
                    remembered for his incisive thinking, his disdain
                    of shibboleth, and his dedication to the solution
                    of a surgical problem.
                    In the development of low-friction arthroplasty,
                    Sir John was always ready to admit serendipity
                    and good luck as well as help from his colleagues,
                    experts in other disciplines and the Manchester
                    Regional Hospital Board. What he never discussed is the superhuman effort and singlemindedness needed to achieve the aim he so
                    firmly believed in.
                    Starting with a single clinical observation of a
                    squeaking femoral head replacement, he repeated
                    experiments on lubrication of joints and disproved the results of others.
                    A biological approach to the problem using
                    Teflon shells to replace articular surfaces of the
                    hip failed. Not discouraged, he continued with
                    Moore and Thompson femoral head replacements
                    articulating on a Teflon shell; the shell moved
                    against the bone causing wear and bone damage.
                    It was at this stage that the concept of “low frictional torque arthroplasty” was conceived and
                    he developed a small diameter femoral head
                    replacement, which articulated with a thick shell
                    of Teflon; the Teflon failed. A lesser man would
                    have surely given up. Yet the short-term clinical
                    results had been so spectacular that he was convinced of the soundness of this concept. From
                    then onwards, with the fortuitous introduction of
                    high-density polyethylene, all his efforts were
                    directed toward a perfect mechanical solution to
                    a biological problem. In this he had the unfailing
                    support of Chas F. Thackray of Leeds. He was the
                    first to use acrylic cement as it should be used—
                    as a grout. Parallel with this was the development
                    of a clean-air operating enclosure, the total body
                    exhaust system, special instruments and the tray
                    system, which has made the operating room
                    an extension of the autoclave and significantly
                    reduced the rate of infection.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4">
                    At the same time Charnley carried on with a
                    very busy clinical practice and teaching both residents and visiting surgeons. He traveled extensively, lecturing, demonstrating and operating. He
                    invariably provided the photographs and drawings for his numerous publications, including Low
                    Friction Arthroplasty of the Hip: Theory and
                    Practice.
                    He was proud of the Centre for Hip Surgery he
                    created and the Low Friction Society formed by
                    his past residents.
                    Every new problem was a challenge to be mastered. When histology of the bone-cement junction was to be studied, he took up the challenge
                    with enthusiasm. Even in his last months of life,
                    when surely he must have been aware that his
                    health was failing, he did not cease to work and
                    plan for the future and was ready to travel to
                    Japan when invited by one of his disciples.
                    In all this he never lost sight of the human
                    aspect and would easily recall patients&apos; details
                    from years before in a chance meeting in the long
                    corridors of the hospital.
                    He will be missed by so many, including those
                    he has worked with and those he has treated and
                    whose lives he has shaped. He was a man of many
                    talents, yet single-minded in his effort. If a man&apos;s
                    claim to immortality is judged by the quality of
                    life he leaves behind and the alleviation of human
                    suffering, then surely the long-term results of
                    the low-friction arthroplasty must be the living
                    monument to a truly great man and benefactor
                    of humanity
