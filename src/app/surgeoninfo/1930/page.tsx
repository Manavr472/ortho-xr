                <p className="mt-4">
                    The history of modern knee arthroplasty is incomplete without mentioning the profound contributions of <strong>John Insall</strong> and <strong>Nas S. Eftekhar</strong>, two of the most influential orthopedic surgeons of the 20th century. Their collaboration at the renowned <strong>Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS)</strong> in New York laid the groundwork for significant advancements in knee replacement surgery, influencing surgical techniques, prosthetic designs, and patient outcomes worldwide.

                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Setting the Stage for Innovation</h3>
                <p className="mt-4">
                    Both Insall and Eftekhar were pioneers in their own right. Insall is widely recognized as one of the founding fathers of total knee replacement surgery. His groundbreaking work on the <strong>Total Condylar Knee prosthesis</strong> in the 1970s established the biomechanical principles that are still followed today. Meanwhile, Eftekhar&apos;s expertise spanned a broader spectrum of joint arthroplasty, including the development of innovative hip and knee prostheses. Their shared tenure at HSS created a fertile ground for collaboration, fostering a culture of interdisciplinary research and clinical excellence.
